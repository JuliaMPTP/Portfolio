          <strong>STUDIES</strong>
          <p>
              During my studies at the univerity I have participated in the making of different projects and works.<br>Some of them are in my CV, but most of them aren't so I'm going to leve here a link to my GitHub.
              <a class="button" href="https://github.com/JuliaMPTP">GitHub</a>
              <br><br>Also, I want to talk about a project, where I made a kind of game where you received points for getting right the things that were in a photo. But I don't have it in my GitHub.

          <strong>FUTURE</strong>
          <p>
              I am still not sure about my future. For now I would like to do an internship somewhere that will teach me what it's like to work and study some areas that I still don't know enough about.<br><br>
              I am still trying to find the field of work that I like in relation to my career.<br><br>
              But I think I will soon find it.
