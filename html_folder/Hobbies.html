          <strong>TRAVELING</strong>
          <p>I have always liked to travel.<br><br> I started traveling since I was little with my family, and I have gone to many places both nationally and internationally.<br><br>
          The most recent trip I have taken abroad was Norway with my brother and cousin. Another one was with my friends to Malaga and now I am planning one to Paris with an Italian friend.</p>

          <strong>COOKING</strong>
          <p>Cooking is something that I have always loved, especially my aunts and uncles instilled it in me. They are very good cooks who learned from my grandmother and have always called me to learn with them. <br>
            My aunt is writing a notebook with my grandmother's recipes and others of her own, she says she will give it to me in the future to continue with my grandmother's traditional recipes.<br>
            My family enjoys food very much, that's why we usually have family meals on weekends.</p>

          <strong>LISTENING TO MUSIC</strong>
          <p>Music is also something that has always been present in my life.<br><br>
            Whether to listen to it in the background or just to listen to it, it has been something that has helped me when I feel bad or when I get bored.<br><br>
            I appreciate music a lot and I certainly like a little bit of everything, otherwise I can get to loathe some genre or artist.</p>
